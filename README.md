# AutomaticTenantSettlement
AutomaticTenantSettlement is an automated solution designed for generating individualized statements for each renter in a multi-tenant property.

## Motivation
The genesis of the AutomaticTenantSettlement project stems from a desire to apply structured software engineering techniques to personal projects. Over the years, I've noticed that a "build-and-fix" approach, while being immediate, often results in software that becomes convoluted and difficult to navigate over time. This observation, backed by past experiences with such projects, highlighted the need for a more structured approach. Here's why:

- **Better Overview**: With a well-planned design, understanding the architecture and flow of the software becomes easier. It acts as a map, directing the developer's efforts and providing clarity.
  
- **Maintainability**: A system built with software engineering principles in mind is more resilient to changes. Whether it's adding new features or debugging, a structured codebase significantly reduces the time and effort required.
  
- **Scalability**: As the requirements grow, the system can adapt without undergoing massive overhauls. This is often not the case in build-and-fix projects where scaling up can lead to breaking the system or introducing unforeseen bugs.
  
- **Avoiding Technical Debt**: Past build-and-fix approaches often accumulated technical debt, making them increasingly harder to update or change. A thought-through design minimizes this debt, ensuring that future adjustments are straightforward.
  
- **Cleaner Code**: Well-structured projects inherently promote cleaner and more readable code. This not only benefits the initial developer but also anyone else who might work on or review the project in the future.

This project, therefore, is a testament to the commitment of avoiding the pitfalls of the "build-and-fix" approach. By taking a more thoughtful and structured path, the aim is to produce software that stands the test of time, both in terms of functionality and maintainability.
